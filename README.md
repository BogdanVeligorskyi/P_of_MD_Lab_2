# P_of_MD_Lab_2
Repository for 2nd lab from Programming of Mobile Devices (Програумвання мобільних пристроїв)

In the process of development Android Studio IDE and Java were used.

The purpose of this lab was modifying application from 1st lab so that list of questions downloads from text file thanks to Service.
Furthermore, instead of activity we had to use fragments. Interface design needed to be done with RelativeLayout and TableLayout.

NOTE: code for this project is located in other branches (not in main).
